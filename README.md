## Give your coding agents DevOps superpowers

Neptune is an app deployment platform built for AI agents that gives your agents real DevOps abilities. It reads your code, infers the infra it needs, and generates a simple IaC spec you can inspect, approve, and apply. Think: coding agents that can actually ship safely to AWS.

## Deploy Your First App

Follow the steps below and you can deploy your app in minutes.

Install the Neptune MCP server:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://neptune.dev/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://neptune.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Getting Started

For example, for Cursor, you can go to Cursor Settings -> Tools & MCP -> New MCP Server:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "neptune": {
            "command": "neptune",
            "args": ["mcp"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Deploy Your App

That's it! Now just tell your agent to deploy your app for you, and Neptune will handle the rest.
